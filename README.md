# Stroke Prediction Model with Cerebral Dataset

## Overview

This project focuses on developing a machine learning model to predict stroke incidence using the Cerebral dataset. The model employs XGBoost for prediction and is integrated into a Streamlit web interface to provide user-friendly access to predictive insights. The project emphasizes optimizing model performance and ensuring effective user interaction.

## Features

- **Predictive Model**: Utilizes XGBoost to forecast stroke incidence based on demographic, health, and lifestyle factors.
- **Streamlit Interface**: Provides an interactive web interface for model predictions and visualizations.
- **Comprehensive Data Processing**: Includes feature scaling, encoding, and outlier treatment.
- **Class Imbalance Handling**: Uses SMOTE to ensure balanced learning between 'stroke' and 'no stroke' instances.
- **Performance Metrics**: Evaluates model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, ROC AUC, and learning curves.
